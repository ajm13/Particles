Gravity
- 1mil particles
- hands are gravity points
- color is determined by last velocity direction controls
- joystick y-axis is attraction (up to repel, down to attract)
- grab with one hand (middle finger grip) to rotate and move environment
- grab with two hands and move hands closer and further apart to zoom
- hold B and Y buttons to make that controller's velocity affect nearby particles

Swarm
- 60k particles
- 3 flocking forces: alignment, cohesion, separation
- hands are force-fields that can capture particles controls
- joystick y-axis temporarily changes forcefield radius
- holding down trigger (index) and moving joystick permanently changes forcefield radius
- grab with one hand (middle finger grip) to rotate and move environment
- grab with two hands and move hands closer and further apart to zoom
- B and Y buttons toggle forcefield for that hand
- A button pauses and plays the flocking simulation
